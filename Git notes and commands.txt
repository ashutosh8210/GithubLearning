First:
Initialize git- use command git init

Git status shows which changes are not maintained
to check status- git status

After that we have to add files to staging area from where it can be 
further committed to git
to do that, use command, git add <filename> or git add . to add all files

After this if you use git status it will show file names green and it means it is staged and ready to commit

To commit, use command git commit -m <commit message>

To unstage from staging area: git restore --staged <filename>

Use git log, to see history
To restore to a previous version or to a point,
git reset <hashcode of git commit>

If we don't want to commit and neither want to lose files after adding to staging area we use stash, first add to staging area then use:
git stash

to bring those files forward
git stash pop

to clean 
git stash clear

***************to connect to github****************
